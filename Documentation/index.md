# Doofes Zeug

Doofes Zeug is an collection of some useful entities/classes for rapid prototyping in .net core
and / or creating some tests for development stuff. Doofes Zeug is designed so that it isn't too complicated. 
It should be easy to use. No expensive security features such as write-protected properties or lists that 
only mean additional work.
