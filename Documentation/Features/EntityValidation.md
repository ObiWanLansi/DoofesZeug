# Entity Validation

An small validation of the entity is planed. There are two different ways (in the order of the evaluation):
- Implement an interface `IValidator` in an class, which can validate more than one property an there coherences.
- Add an attribute to an property (e.g. `Min()`, `Max()`, `Range()`, `Length()`).
- Add an attribute to an entity (e.g. `Min()`, `Max()`, `Range()`, `Length()`).
